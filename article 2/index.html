    <h2>Detailed Info about cars</h2>

    <p>
     A quarter of a century from now, those of us who enjoy driving will still be turning the steering wheel, pressing the pedals and shifting the gearlever with our own limbs, via inputs from our brains and feedback from our senses.</p>

<h2>What sort of engine will my car have?</h2>

<p>As we move closer to 2040, “the majority of cars will be electrified in some way and the engine may no longer be the primary drive; its role would be to support an electric motor”, says Ricardo’s chief technical and innovation officer, Neville Jackson. In that case, the engine is likely to be smaller, highly boosted by turbocharger or an electrical boost system and redefine the idea of high efficiency.

Alternatively, engines may become a hybrid between a petrol and a diesel engine, switching between spark and compression ignition and possibly burning a future cocktail of fossil and synthetic fuel. “The technical opportunities are immense,” says Jackson, “and for the average motorist, cars will just get better and more efficient.”</p>

<h2>Will hydrogen power take off?</h2>

<p>For almost two decades, the world has been tantalised by the idea of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), with ample range and no tailpipe emissions except water and heat. Now the chances of the hydrogen fuel cell car gaining a major foothold by 2040 are improving.

“If the hydrogen infrastructure business model works and the car manufacturers become serious, there could be a significant ramp-up after 2020. You could be looking at millions to tens of millions of cars by 2040,” says David Hart of sustainable energy consultant E4Tech and former head of fuel cells at Imperial College. </p>

<h2>What sort of tyres will my car have?</h2>

<p>Tyres are already an integral part of a car’s performance today, but they will have an even bigger role to play by 2040. “The trend for 2040 is for cars to be connected. Interest is growing in using big data by connecting vehicles so they can communicate information about road conditions,” explains Goodyear’s director of technology programmes, Romain Hansen.

The first stage will be connecting tyres wirelessly to the vehicle to improve safety. “If the vehicle knows the composition of the tyre and how it performs, the ABS system can reduce stopping distances in all conditions,” says Hansen.

Once that stage is reached, cars will be able to share information about the road surface condition and temperature with other vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity (V2V). Adaptive tyres demonstrated by Goodyear’s TripleTube concept will change shape according to road conditions and use. In the wet, the pressure will increase to produce a longer contact patch better able to resist aquaplaning.</p>

<h2>Who, or what, will be driving my car?</h2>

<p>Will we be driving the cars of the future or will they be driving us? Probably a bit of both and all major manufacturers are working on self-driving cars today. Autonomous technology isn’t new. It has been creeping up on us for two decades, says Tony Harper, head of research at Jaguar Land Rover. “We are on a trajectory that began with radar, adaptive cruise control, then blind spot monitoring, which moved radar to the sides of the car, and now there are forward-facing cameras.”

The next stage is sensor integration and further development of software algorithms. “By 2020, we’ll see parking functions joined by low-speed manoeuvring in traffic jams and some high-speed driving, like lane changing, will become automated,” says Harper.

Beyond 2020, more complex sensors such as lidar will be needed and Harper thinks the first production applications of full autonomy will be “short-range missions”, like fully autonomous valet parking and autonomous driving in dedicated lanes of motorways. The number of zones will grow as the infrastructure is developed to accept autonomous vehicles, but eventually, says Harper, “restrictions will drop off one by one until we get to full autonomy. No one knows exactly when that will be, but the journey will start by 2025.”</p>
